# App Upgrade Example

This is a simple Flutter application that demonstrates how to prompt users to check for updates and upgrade their app when a new version is available.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your_repository
   ```

3. Open the project in your preferred Flutter IDE or text editor.

4. Run the application on your preferred emulator or physical device.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have Flutter installed on your development machine.

## How to Use

1. When you run the application, you will see a button labeled "Check for Updates."

2. Tap the "Check for Updates" button to trigger a dialog box asking if you want to update the application.

3. The dialog box will display information about the current version of the application and the new version available. It also provides details about the changes in the new version.

4. You can choose to update the application immediately by tapping the "Update Now" button or postpone the update by tapping the "Later" button.

5. If you choose to update now, the application will launch the Google Play Store (or the respective app store for your platform) where users can download the latest version of the app.
